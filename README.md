# Car_Classification

The dataset used in this project is the car evaluation dataset, which we downloaded from [the UCI directory] https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation 
it is a dataframe with 6 features, 1 class variable and 1728 instances.
The objective of this project is to build and compare models which predict if a car is acceptable or not comparing the condition of the car to its price. All variables in our dataframe are categorical (no outliers) and there are no null values.
We will apply minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm for feature selection, decision trees, knn as single classifiers and finally bagging and adaboost as ensemble classifiers.
